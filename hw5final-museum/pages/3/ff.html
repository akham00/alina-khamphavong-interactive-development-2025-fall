      It flashes bright,
    then fades away. It
 can't protect; it only
        destroys.

<div id="revealText">
There's a character named Lightning… she’s stoic, pretty, and has spiky pink hair.
I remember vividly that I begged my mom to cut my hair like hers.

It didn’t really work out. It’s pretty hard to translate into real life aaand I wasn’t allowed to have pink hair at that age.

Despite my attachment to her, I honestly have no idea what this game is actually about. Even now I’m kind of clueless.

I’m vaguely aware it’s a fighting game? The storyline seems very complicated, but I always thought the overall style was beautiful.
