    when i was little,<br><br>

    playing on the xbox<br><br>
    and no matter how much older i became,<br>
    the memory still sticks to<br>
    the back of my head. . .

<h2>Tasty-Looking Ice Cream</h2>
<p> <br> I never knew what was going on, 
 all I knew this game for was
  the anime-styled characters fighting alongside
   random disney characters
 like Mickey Mouse and Goofy.</br>
 

<br>I always thought the music was so beautiful,
  <u>Utada Hikaru</u>
    is the woman who's behind the opening. 
     I think she's incredibly popular now in the US,
       it wasn't the case back then 
       until the introduction of KH, 
       i'm glad she gets the attention she deserves. </br>

<br>I remember so clearly, that 'sea-salt' ice cream and
 I wanted one SO badly. 
 The characters would eat them 
 from time to time, 
 and it was really prominent
  on the CRT TV, the glistening glow of the blue popsicle. </br> </p>
