    when i was little,<br><br>

    <h2>Tasty-Looking Ice Cream</h2>
<p> <br> I never knew what was going on, 
 all I knew this game for was
  the anime-styled characters fighting alongside
   random disney characters
 like Mickey Mouse and Goofy.</br>
 

<br>I always thought the music was so beautiful,
  <u>Utada Hikaru</u>
    is the woman who's behind the opening. 
     I think she's incredibly popular now in the US,
       it wasn't the case back then 
       until the introduction of KH, 
       i'm glad she gets the attention she deserves. </br>

<br>I remember so clearly, that 'sea-salt' ice cream and
 I wanted one SO badly. 
 The characters would eat them 
 from time to time, 
 and it was really prominent
  on the CRT TV, the glistening glow of the blue popsicle. </br> </p>

    <h2>Funky Beats and Skates</h2>
    <p><br>It's still such a favorite game of mine,
       I ended up playing this when I was old enough to.</br>

       <br>I actually tried to learn skating 
       with rollerblades when I was younger
       because I was so inspired, but... </br>

       <br>I kept falling on my butt and
       I got pretty mad about it and gave up.
       Maybe I should pick it back up.</br>

    <h2>Stylish Characters Fighting</h2>
    <p>
       <br> There's a character named Lightning, 
        she's stoic, pretty, and has spiky pink hair. 
           I remember vividly that I begged my mom 
           to cut my hair like hers.</br>

           <br> It didn't really work out.

           it's pretty hard to translate into real life.
            </br>

          <br>  And I wasn't allowed to have pink hair 
           at that age.
          </br>
      
        <br>  Despite my attachment to that character,
      I have idea what this game is about, 
      
      to be honest,
       I still don't really know. 

      I'm just kind of aware it's a fighting game?
      The storyline seems pretty complicated. 
      Maybe I should play this now that I'm older. </br>

    <h2>Shooting Colorful Aliens </h2>
    <p>I remember this being 
      one of the few games that I was able to 
      play with my brother,
      because it was couch-op.

      I unfortunately don't think
       I was a very helpful teammate 
       when I was 8 years old.
